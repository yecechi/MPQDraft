The common folder consists of library files used by MPQDraft. These files are written with the intent of them being used in many projects, MPQDraft or otherwise (and indeed are used by many projects by the author). As these files are intended to be program nonspecific, header files in this directory are included with <file> notation, so the build environment must be configured to search this directory.
